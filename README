In this notebook I'm working on a learning based approach for the multi-reference alignment problem. I try to reconstruct a two-dimentional image from one-dimentional images, whose angles are unknown by the algorithm. 

To that end, I generate two dimentional random concave hulls and simulate their images to create training data for the learning algorithm. I will test the algorithms success recovering the image's angles, from which point on there are readily available mathematical methods to reconstruct the whole image using images and their rotation angles. 

After I measure how well the angles are recovered, I will also build another model where the whole two dimentional image would be reconstructed by an end-to-end learning algorithm, without needing a seperate mathematical tool for the reconstruction step.

Upon the completion of these steps, I will add another layer of complexity by decreasing the signal to noise ratio with adding random gaussian noise to the one-dimentional inputs.

If these tests prove to be successful and that a learning based approach could be used for reconstruction, I will extent the solution to recovering three-dimentional objects from their two-dimentional images. To that end, I plan to use Cryo-EM data and reconstruct three-dimentional molecules from their images.
